## Malevolent Ghosts

Some gossips in Ferncombe are convinced that the ghosts of the family and the servants that lived in the house haunt their home, attacking and running off anyone who dares set foot in the place. Local legends state that the curse of the estate can be broken, but the means varies wildly between sources:

- Spend the night, and by dawn you’ll become the new owner of the manor!
- Cleanse each room with a whole vial of holy water, and when the last room is done, the ghosts will depart.
- Help each of the ghosts finish their business so that they can move on to the afterlife.
- Surround the manor, all its thresholds and window sills with salt, then invoke a divine power.
- Travel to the heart of the hedge maze on the grounds, and there you’ll find the source of power anchoring the ghosts.

## Deadly Stalkers

Rumor is that anyone trying to sleep overnight in the old estate, whether that be in or outside the house, will be murdered in their sleep by bandits! Worse still, if you die on the grounds, your soul ends up trapped there forever, unable to escape! Of course, nobody recently has been up there so nobody has any idea if it’s true, but some older folks in the town can confirm that folk went missing up around there in years prior.

## Portal to Hell

Some say demons reside in the house, or that there is a portal to hell itself somewhere in the deepest pit of the manor undercroft. More than one greedy soul has traveled up there, braving ghosts and demons hoping to trade away their souls for riches, fame or success. Unsurprisingly, none have ever come back from these jaunts.

## Giant Spiders

Musings from local scouts, foragers and hunters are that the huge old tree at the back of the estate is home to hundreds of giant spiders, some large enough to take down men with a single bite, and that they’ve seen man-shaped forms hanging from the tree, wrapped in webs. Most hunters steer well clear of that area just to be safe, even if eye-witness sightings are scarce.
