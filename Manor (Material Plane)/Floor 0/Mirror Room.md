Once held a collection of things

Tarnished frame of a massive mirror on the south east wall

Gouges on the wall by the mirror are magical in origin
Conjuration and Abjuration was there at the time
Looks like the mirror would have worked as a planar gateway to another mirror on another plane

Opening to the north continues into the [[Private Collection]]
