Center of the room holds a shattered piano

Western side is less ruined

Thick layer of dust over the debris, but patchy in some places
Seems more like salt than dust
Skin decay
Halfling sized bones underneath the rubble - Noble

Found the body of [[Perrius Anmatar]] under the rubble by a door - This person was dressed very well
Blue waistcoat
Black blazer
Gold finish
Shoulder has green feathers
Atop the head, caved into the skull is a hat
