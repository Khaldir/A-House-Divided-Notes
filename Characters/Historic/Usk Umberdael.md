Butler and Confidante of [[Lord Darius Corvinarus]]

>[!quote] [[Letter to Usk, the Faithful]]
>Your service to our house has always been more than a mere butler. You have been one of my closest confidants and dearest friends, and I hope that you know that I could never have asked for a more faithful companion to see me through the most difficult moments of my life.

Met as a ghost passing through the [[Sitting Room]]

>Usk was promised "*a healthy stipend of coin*" in a [[Assorted Notes|note]] dated twenty years ago - If he last saw Byscilla when she was nine, then we can put together a timeframe based on Byscilla's current age.

Warned that there was no coming back from crossing a Threshold in the [[Dining Room]]

Usk appeared more "present" when speaking of the family

Usk appears knowledgeable about the situation - more together than when we met his "ghost"
