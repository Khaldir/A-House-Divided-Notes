# Meeting at Ferncombe

>[!abstract]
>We encountered Byscilla again whilst returning to Ferncombe for rest

- Byscilla says she last spoke with Usk when she was around 10 years old
^ByscillaLastSpokeWithUsk
- Emotional response to hearing Usk could be alive
- Unaware of experiments
- [[Lord Darius Corvinarus|Grandfather]] showed her a "trick" while young
	- Draped a velvet sheet over a toy pony
	- Gone but not really
	- Took on different shapes but at core still a pony
	- Could see it, and also see through it
	- A chance "they" are still alive
	- Not a transformation - like turning a switch - almost instantly
	- Could line up with [[Star Phenomenon]] in terms of timing, but hard to tell

## Our Questioning
- House looked like the site of a battle
- Remembers grandfather as being kind
	- His warmth and humour drained with the death of her [[Ylana|Grandmother]]
- Discovered papers to the estate - by law Byscilla was in line to inherit
- Mother disappeared shortly after leaving the estate (around 20 years back) ^2c9cc8
	- According to her Father, her Mother wanted to create a life for them
	- Remembers an argument - her Father was not best pleased with her Mother going to an event at the estate
		- This event could be the one mentioned in [[Letter to Elscieth]]
- Handed over the [[Book of Cantrip Magic]]
- Father deserves answers too
- Travelled 3 weeks to get here
- Have her blessing to force entry to parts of the house
