A thin, tarnished ring made of gold with a decorative flourish and small setting with a green gem. It has seen better days, is a bit bent and in need of cleaning. It appears sized for a woman's hand.

The ring was found in the [[Workshop turned Storage Room]], in the back of a drawer - it likely belonged to [[Ylana]].

There is the ghost of an engraving on the inside of the ring, though it's hard to make out what it says due to wear.
