Not unlike the layers of coiled around grits of sand, planes tend to coat objects in its own nacreous substances. I should find a better term for this and the material that it results in, as it is both magical energy and physical matter in one. However, I am too tired to do so.

For now let my notes bear witness: The action of coating these objects does not result in a new state matter, or new novel material. What it makes is neither. My colleagues may fight me on this at some other time.

This page is then consumed with diagrams of orbs with numerous concentric circles around it, and extensive mathematical and magical annotations about the frequencies and intensities of planar energy, which are directly related to how long the object sits. Additional equations appears to be a mixture of observation and prediction.

The notes begin again toward the bottom of the page in new ink.

These planar pearls, such as I will call them, are created by placing objects that do not belong in the plane at a place of particularly strong magical flow. Here the objects collect layers of planar magic, which in turn enhance the natural resonance of the object itself, manipulating the planar frequencies to become a mix of the two.

The true challenge is finding proper sites for this process to be carried out. Regardless, it will take time.
