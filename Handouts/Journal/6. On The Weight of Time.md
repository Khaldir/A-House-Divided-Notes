I pondered over how best to create a planar pearl suffused in the resonance of the prime material, and for a long while could not come up with a means to do so. Eventually it occurred to me that it is through time and change and growth that all things become suffused with magic here. Sentimentality is its own form of magic, after all.

Time would prove the essential component. In the crook of our beloved old tree this locket would collect the weight and magic of time, gathering around it the nacreous layers of the material plane, adding them to its already monumental importance to this place and the souls that touched it.

It would take the ==longest of the pearls to become wholly resonant==, but I am resolved to wait. Time is much less of a concern now, and eventually would be none at all. I still have plenty of other designs to pore over while I wait.
