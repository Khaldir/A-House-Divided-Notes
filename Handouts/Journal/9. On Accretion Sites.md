I have ascertained the ideal locations for threading enhanced accretion. By planting "grits of sand," so to speak, in the Shadowfell and Feywild, and drawing energy through them I can rapidly speed up the rate of accretion, yielding large, powerful pearls that I can use for arcane tethering, or the creation of planar quintessence.

Since time flows so inconsistently on these planes, it should only be a matter of weeks before I am able to begin grasping and threading energies from due to their slight connection to their home plane. From that point onward the process will become increasingly rapid, allowing me to ==harvest large amounts of raw planar medium for later processing==.

I will admit that part of me wonders what I would find were I to leave them there, only to find occasion to return and fish them out again. I would be quite curious to see what forms they take on due to the magical influence.

But I am rambling. This was the easiest part. Creating the planar quintessence remains a process I have yet to fully streamline. It is still a slow, arduous process which yields very little.

A quick note is jotted at the bottom, an afterthought:

As I forgot to mention it in this passage initially — the specific locations I have selected are within the high boughs of the ancient trees reflected in my estate's land. They have stood longer than mast anything in this area, and they are all nearly identical across the planes. This means they all should be strong eddies of planar energies.
>[!quote]- [[2. On Planar Threading]]
>These eddies are in fact planar event horizons through which I can thread more magic than is produced by the resonance frequencies themselves. Like thread through the eye of a needle, I can keep pulling more through, as the planes are effectively infinite spools of thread.

I am slightly concerned about what may happen to these trees over a longer period of time. Is there a form of planar erosion from the magical flow? Would the reflected trees become mutated? I don't know. I can't know, not yet. In time I will, however.
