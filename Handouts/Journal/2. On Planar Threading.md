The old madman's ravings proved useful, if not directly, but by helping frame my own thoughts properly. It is a pity he lost his faculties entirely, I might have enjoyed seeing the look on his face were I to show him my notes.

Building off the concepts of planar resonance which I wrote of here previously, I am utilizing carefully tuned evocation wards I have achieved vibrational frequency matching within extraplanar crystals. This in turn has created sympathetic magical eddies which I can use abjuring wards to direct and reshape.

These eddies are in fact planar event horizons through which I can thread more magic than is produced by the resonance frequencies themselves. Like thread through the eye of a needle, I can keep pulling more through, as the planes are effectively infinite spools of thread.

Using lenses and dampeners I can refine this energy and focus it through magical apparatus which in turn fuel various other magical circles and devices. This chain of connected devices allows me a nearly unlimited font of energy to work with.

The larger the crystal, the more power I can pull, though there is some diminishing return after a point.
