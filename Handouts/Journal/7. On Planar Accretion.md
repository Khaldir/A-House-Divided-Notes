Planar Accretion.

This is what I shall call it. I have dated and stamped this page with my current academic seal to prove when the term was coined, should any of my colleagues wish to challenge me. Not that I think anyone is mad enough to subject themselves to this subject aside from me.

Regardless! The process shall be called Planar Accretion, as that is what it is. I do not have a name for the nacreous layers deposited by the process, and planar nacre still does not suit me. In time I will find a new name for it.

Now, what is more important is that I have found that I can speed up the process of planar accretion by using a starting pearl (I still lack a better term for this as well) and planar threading. By forcing large amounts of planar energies to flow over whatever my chosen piece of "grit" is I can vastly speed up the natural process with no ill effects. This in turn allows me to create new, larger pearls much faster which I can use to make more.

This may be the next step in my bid for large-scale production of planar quintessence. Though these endeavors will need to wait until I am pursuing less pressing matters which will take me away from home and my sanctum.
