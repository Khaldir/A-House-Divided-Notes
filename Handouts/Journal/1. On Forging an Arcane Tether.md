Below I have copied a transcript of a ritual taken from Olforth's _Planar Bindings and Portals_. His designs were rudimentary, and oriented to travel, but I think Olforth was onto something fundamentally important to my own intent, and proper adaptation of the ritae contained within his work may prove essential to furthering my own.

Olforth's near-rhyming pedantry is difficult to decipher but there are pieces of invaluable information nestled within. Unfortunately, Olforth had gone quite mad during the writing of _Planar Bindings_, leaving those of us still in full possession of our faculties to try to sort the madness from the real. His materials for composing the ritual circles are absolute nonsense, so much that I am forced to wonder if he was intentionally misleading an apprentice.

> There are two things which are sufficient for the operation of all planar travel. The former is active, the latter passive.
> 
> First and foremost the essence which runs in all things, and through all things, comes and goes away bright, it is in all things bright, and at the same time shadowed and unknown. These pieces of what make us whole is assembled by the parts of a greater essence, shone through a lens into our world which, as it condenses, composes that which is the stuff that makes us. This essential energy, when it is by it self (no other matter coming to it, in which it should manifest its proper action) is boundless, and invisible, of itself sufficient for every action that is proper to it, moveable, and yielding itself after a manner to all things that come next to it.

> The essences known have a renewing, guarding nature, and can be understood as inherent, never dissipating nor collapsing, eternal. Others have noted them in detail, with their heavens and their hells and their dynamics and their statics and their lights and their shadows and their order and their chaos. What they do not comprehend is that any energy which perpetually flows is itself perpetual, and thus limitless. Portals between realms then are sustained not by our own ethereal energy but by that which is perpetually flowing from out of the realm such a binding connects to. Such a binding does not stand in need of another, secretly increasing of itself, and manifests its greatness to things that receive it.

> The ritual to compose such a portal is carefully balanced against stars and their geometries, shaped by line and circle, held in check by crystal, chalk, fire, ash, stone, and whatever essential materials most closely aligned with the realm from which the portal and its energies shall flow. All the stars and their peculiar natures, properties, and conditions must be accounted for when composing the seals and characters or the rays of essence of the planes will not adequately form to bind the sigil set. About and within the circles, in opposition to one another, place the signs and markings of those planes which in opposition stand, omitting the signs of our realm and the sign of the plane to which the tether shall adhere. 

I believe for this to be successful I should need to harness the energies described here by way of some sort of edifice. By assembling suitable methods of focusing the energy, it should be possible to direct it into separate locus, where (if it can be suitably contained) I should be able to empower other…
