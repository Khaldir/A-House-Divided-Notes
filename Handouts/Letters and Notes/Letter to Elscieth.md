[[Elscieth|My Beloved Daughter]],

I know that it has been some time since last we wrote, and even longer since we last visited. I recognize that the majority of blame for that inconsideration rests upon me. I am sorry that I have not made time to see you, [[Betrand]] or little [[Byscilla Danos|Byscilla]] in the last year.
^ElsciethBetrandByscilla

In your last letter you wrote that you were pained to "watch my descent into all-consuming grief" and I had no answer for you then. Please understand that while we all felt your mother's death keenly, none felt it as sharply as me. I had not the words to say as much then, and it is certainly no surprise to you now.

I know that it hurts you to see me suffer, and I do not wish that upon you. We are family, I want nothing but happiness and success for you. You must understand that even if it does not appear so in my vast and unceasing grief, I cherish every moment I have had with you and the beautiful family you have.

With the anniversary of her death approaching, I would like to see you again, but I must warn you that I have also invited [[Kryn Corvinarus|Kryn]], and I know he will be in attendance. I believe that your mother would wish for you two to be reconciled, to leave this trouble and past behind, and be a family once more.

For the anniversary of the night she passed, I am gathering the family, her friends, and those dignitaries who knew her to celebrate her life and remember her as she wasâ€”rather than the senseless cruelty that took her from us. There will be dinner and dancing, and all the things which she so cherished in life. I hope that you will attend, and that we can find some time to put this misery in the past. ^2b4065

If you do not feel you can spare the time to visit, nor risk suffering the cruelty of your brother, I will understand. I hope that even so you would find it within you to accept my apology, for truly I am sorry.

With love eternally,

Your father, [[Lord Darius Corvinarus|Darius Corvinarus]]
