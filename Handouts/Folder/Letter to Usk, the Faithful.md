My faithful servant, [[Usk Umberdael|Usk]]

If things have proceeded as I have planned, I know that you must have been shocked by everything which transpired at [[Ylana]]'s Remembrance and the dinner which followed. I can only imagine how you must feel, and I hope that you know that there is nothing you could have done to turn events in another direction. Be absolvedâ€” you did all that you could, as you always did, to smooth the way for me and ease the burdens of my troubled mind.

Your service to our house has always been more than a mere butler. You have been one of my closest confidants and dearest friends, and I hope that you know that I could never have asked for a more faithful companion to see me through the most difficult moments of my life.

The letter has been torn here.
