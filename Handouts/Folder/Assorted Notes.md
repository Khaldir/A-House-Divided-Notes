These pages appear to be wandering thoughts and jotted notes, less neat and long-winded than the others. Each one part of a jumbling of thoughts that needed to be on paper before they could become something else.

I am feeling trepidation at what comes next. There are many moving parts and things I cannot predict. If [[Kryn Corvinarus|Kryn]] does not act as I expect him to I will need to do something drastic. Like naming [[Usk Umberdael|Usk]] the heir to the estate. Hell, the lad can have it if he wants and [[Elscieth|El]] does not, he'd do better than [[Kryn Corvinarus|Kryn]] by any measure.

Dated a few days later, the page bears only the following:

Arrangements are made for the paperwork, there will be no disputing them, regardless of what is said before the guests and the gods. [[Elscieth]] can do with the manor as she chooses.
^ElsciethInheritance

In regards to my ties and responsibilities, I have completed much of the hand off to other parties in the family, or beyond, with some place in hold for [[Byscilla Danos|Byscilla]] when she is old enough. I don't like to burden her, but the coin will make her life easier.

The papers and deeds will arrive with them, in the event they never make it to her mother.

A sole page in red ink, hasty and uneven:

Before I forget: [[Usk Umberdael|Usk]] is promised a healthy stipend of coin from the family coffers. Enough to start a new home for himself, a new life, or run this place if it somehow ends up in his hands. The details are below.

Sure enough, scribbled notes and an attached with file numbers and bank locations are added, detailing that one [[Usk Umberdael]] is to be afforded a stipend of 100,000 gold pieces, to be held in reserve until whenever he so chooses to collect it. It is dated for twenty years ago.
