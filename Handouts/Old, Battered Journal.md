This aged and rotten journal was once finely made, with a secure clasp, beautiful leather cover and finely bound pages. It is only by virtue of how well made this book once was that it has survived decades at the mercy of the elements.

What few, barely legible passages remain discuss the life and events of [[Elscieth|a young woman]] growing up in this estate. The author is the daughter of [[Lord Darius Corvinarus|the lord]], and she appears to have largely been happy save for chronic bullying from her little brother.
